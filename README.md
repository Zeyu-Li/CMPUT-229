### Circuits

Circuits discussed in this course are not complex and do not approach the difficulty of the compE courses. The basic overview of this part of the course can be done by watching the following video by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ)

Where the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim) and the download [here](#https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim)

Although I have made a completed what has been done on the video and packaged it up [here on the release]
