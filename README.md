### Circuits

Circuits discussed in this course are not complex and do not approach the difficulty of the compE courses. The basic overview of this part of the course can be done by watching the following video by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ)

Although I have made a completed what has been done on the video and packaged it up [here on the release](https://github.com/Zeyu-Li/CMPUT-229/releases/tag/v1)

### Marking

Marks for this class include 6 quizzes (drop lowest one), 3 midterms, and a final project. The raw marks map directly to the grade you get from the regular marks table. Labs and assignments are also marked but do not count towards the final grade. These are highly recommended since they act as homework assignments, however even if you do not finish it by the hand in date, you can do them later.
